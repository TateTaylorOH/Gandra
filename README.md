High in the hidden reaches of Skyrim lies a monastery older than the province itself. Forgotten to history, the ruin was once a center of Falmer culture and learning. Now it is trapped in time between the present and the day of its destruction. A dark force has began to stir in its ancient halls. More than echoes of the past exist in Gandra.
